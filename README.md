# Impacts on Society

This impact plan is designed for AP Computer Science A, an advanced placement course targeting students in grades 10 through 12. The curriculum is rigorously focused on teaching coding fundamentals and the object-orientaed programming (OOP) paradigm using the Java language. This document will outline how issues of computing impacts on society will be implemented into this course. The plan will outline a unit plan in which students are assigned roles. Students will create a simulation of a social media algorithm. They will have to debate amongst themselves to balance profits, outreach, user experience, and mental health. The project will dive deep into the impact that social media algorithms have on society. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to describe and illustrate how recommendation algorithms operate at a basic computational level by identifying inputs, decision rules, and outputs.
Students will be able to analyze the effects of modifying algorithmic parameters on content recommendations and infer potential impacts on user experience and mental health.
Students will be able to evaluate ethical tradeoffs in recommendation algorithm design by defending design decisions using evidence generated from their code outputs.


### Learning Activities

The unit will integrate multiple learning activities that combines individual coding, small group coding, debate, and discussion-based reflection. 
Students will be assigned roles such as CEO, Marketing Officer, User Experience Officer, and Social Advocate. 

Each student will complete small parts of the code individually and the group as a whole will put together a basic social media algorithm using a given dataset. The students will then be given prompts and tools to determine how they will configure their specific algorithm. Students will be given data that shows that depression and anxiety rise in relation to the level of emotion that a user feels. Students can play with different datasets and algorithm to decide if they will make it highly addicting and thus profitable. Or hey can make it less entertaining, but preserve the mental health of their user base, or they can do something unique and creative. Each student will have homework that will require them to find an article or a debate point that supports their given perspective, so that they can come to school ready to argue why the app should be created the way they think and the potential impact of that. Students will also be asked to look at their own social media and do a reflection based on their given perspective. The learning activities will incorporate coding with real life use cases and ethical decision making. The learning activities will span a number of class periods. I estimate 1-2 weeks. 

### Assessment

I will assess the learning objectives above by incorporating formative assessment as well as summative assessment. The summative assessment for the project will include a write up from each student about the stance they took on the social media algorithm and what they learned from that perspective. I would also like them to compare and contrast the perspective of their assigned role with what they personally believe should be done with something like a social media algorithm. Additionally, a correct, completed code for the group will be assessed to make sure that it functions as intended. Finally, a group presentation on the project will be given where the group discusses the challenges, expectations, and decisions they had while creating the project and debating with each other. 


Additionally, I will use formative assessments to make sure that students are understanding the information they are learning and that they are participating in the debates. I will formatively assess students by walking around the room and listening to the conversations they are having while occasionally jumping in as a board member to throw some problem or different idea into the mix. I will also use formative assessments such as exit slips to make sure that students can individually write the code for small parts of the algorithm they are creating. Finally, I will use code reviews with other groups to market test the app and get feedback as to whether or not the algorithm is working as one would expect. 


### Outcomes

My plan will help facilitate diversity, equity, and inclusion and help broaden participation in computing by forcing students into roles where they must take perspectives they might not normally consider. In the context of social media, this allows students to view technology from the perspective of a creator rather than only as a consumer. This approach creates opportunities for meaningful discussion about students’ backgrounds, personal use of social media, and life experiences.
In addition, students will see that a career or involvement in computing can have real effects on society. Depending on their role and perspective, they can recognize that they have the ability to make an impact through the technologies they design and the decisions they make.
The course plan also supports long-term goals in addressing the societal impacts of computing by requiring students to pause and discuss the effects that computing can have. Many students today grow up with a phone or tablet in their hands from a young age, which often leads to accepting technology without question and using it without considering potential consequences. Throughout the discussions in this course, the impacts of algorithms, artificial intelligence, and computing are explored from both positive and negative perspectives.
This plan is intended to help students recognize that while computing can provide powerful benefits, it also has the potential to cause harm. By engaging in these discussions and activities, students are encouraged to think critically about technology and to contribute to society in innovative and positive ways while remaining aware of the ethical responsibilities that come with computing.
